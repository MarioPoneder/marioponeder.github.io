An introduction about me and my company.  
Next section: [The security review process](#the-security-review-process)

### Decentralizing the future, block by block ...
Hi, I am Mario Poneder, a former software engineer who found his way into the Web3 space and gladly offer you my services as an **independent smart contract security researcher**.

You might already know me by my alias 0xTheC0der, since I am active on multiple decentralized audit platforms and participating in bug bounty programs.  

> ✅ **I pursue one clear target**  
> With my continuous contribution to the Web3 security landscape, I want to help innovators like you to build a decentralized future, block by block, and therefore drive adoption.

### My professional journey began ...

… as a developer in the fields of industrial automation and [GPU-accelerated parallel computing](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/), after finishing a school focused on electronics and computer engineering.  
Later on, while getting my master’s degree in engineering physics, I was performing particle physics simulations for a [dark matter research project](https://cresst-experiment.org/).  
After graduating from university, I took the opportunity to work as the lead embedded software engineer for an emerging company which manufactures electrical drives for intralogistics applications.   
In parallel to this job, I kept pursuing my interest in blockchain technologies and eventually came to the realization, that there is an emerging demand for developers which are confident with the current state of this technology and are open for what is yet to come.   
This has led me to the firm decision to pivot my career and found **Decentra Vision** in the beginning of the year 2022.  

Since then, I have had a lot of amazing experiences such as exchanging knowledge with inspiring like-minded individuals, working on sophisticated codebases and spotting severe vulnerabilities.  
All of this has contributed to finding my true passion in reviewing smart contracts to make the Web3 space safer and therefore drive adoption, while enhancing my skillset as an **independent security researcher** along the journey.


## The security review process
A brief overview about the security review process, what to expect and how you can benefit from it.

### 1. Let me know about your project &ndash; Get a quote

**Get in touch** with me using one of the [communication channels](#social-buttons) above and please provide me with the following information about your project:

- Link to the **source code repository** and definition of files, folders or contracts in **scope**.  
*In case of a private repository, please invite [@MarioPoneder](https://github.com/MarioPoneder) as a collaborator.*  
- Relevant specifications, **documentation** and previous audit reports, if already available depending on the current stage of your project.  
- Link to the parent project, in case this is a **fork**.  
- Your **projected timeline**, i.e. do you need a security review now or in a few weeks/months?  
- Further **questions** or information from your side.  

> ℹ️ **Important**  
> All non-public information shared with me will be treated as confidential.

### 2. Preparing for kick-off &ndash; Determining our collaboration
Once you provided me with the required information, I will proceed to **pre-review** your codebase and afterwards get back to you for scheduling a call &ndash; could also be a chat if you prefer &ndash; in order to cover the following topics:
- **First findings** walkthrough, in case I could already identify bugs/vulnerabilities during the pre-review.
- Locking the **commit hash** for the main security review.
- Breakdown of the **quote** and downpayment.  
  *The quote is based on a severity-tiered per-finding price model. You are free to opt for a fixed hourly rate instead, if you prefer.*
- Determining if our **collaboration is the right fit** for both sides.
- Setting the **timeline** for the main security review.

> ℹ️ **Important**  
> All findings identified during the pre-review are free of charge, irrespective of you proceeding to collaborate with me or not.

### 3. Main security review &ndash; Communication is key

Apart from being focused on the full security assessment of your codebase, the main security review involves the following aspects:
- A kick-off call  &ndash; optional, but highly recommended &ndash; where you provide me with **in-depth insights** into your protocol and/or a walkthrough of select parts of the codebase.  
*This will give me a headstart into the security review which usually turns out to be beneficial when identifying vulnerabilities.*
- Every time a relevant **finding** is uncovered, I will proceed to share it with you **immediately** via our dedicated communication channel &ndash; could also be a new issue in a private repository &ndash; including recommended **mitigation steps** and a runnable proof-of-concept, depending on the complexity of the finding.  
*This way, you can already work on issue mitigation in parallel to the security review.*
- At the end of the main review, you will receive a **preliminary report** in Markdown format covering all the bugs/vulnerabilities which were identified to date.  
*There might also be multiple non-critical findings and recommendations which are better wrapped up in a dedicated call instead of being part of the report.*

> ⚠️ **Warning**  
> Despite the relentless striving to uncover all bugs/vulnerabilities within a given codebase, this process is mainly bound by time and expertise. Consequently, no security researcher including myself can guarantee 100% security and flawless future functionality after a review.  
> A security review is no substitute for an overall security strategy, but yet an important component of it.  

### 4. Mitigation review &ndash; Finalization

Once the main review has concluded, it only takes the following steps to get the best out of the issue mitigation phase:
- Please **comment** on each bug/vulnerability outlined in the preliminary report with a link to the commit that **resolves** it or acknowledge it as "won't fix".  
*Thereby, it is best practice to fix only one issue within one commit for clarity.*
- Each of your **mitigation commits** will be **reviewed** concerning correctness and security.  
  *Note that new features, comprehensive refactoring or architectural changes are not part of the mitigation review.*
- At the end of the mitigation review, you will receive a **finalized report** in Markdown format covering all previously uncovered bugs/vulnerabilities and their reviewed mitigation measures.  
  *The report will be delivered as a PDF file, if requested.*

> 📝 **Note**  
> Although I can understand your wish to keep the final report confidential, I'd highly appreciate your approval to publish it.


### Extra: Ongoing security consulting &ndash; I've got your back
This service is independent from the security review and can be booked separately on demand.  
I am here to help you with your future security concerns, e.g.:
- Deploying and initializing your protocol on-chain, i.e. **going live**.
- Reviewing new contracts and other changes on **protocol upgrades**.  
   *Basically a light version of the above security review.*
- Bug bounty report analysis and **mitigation consulting**.
